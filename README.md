## 🏗 Architecture

AOMaaS follows a modular architecture with these key components:

- **API Layer**: FastAPI-based REST endpoints
- **Service Layer**: Core business logic implementation
- **Provider Layer**: Multi-cloud provider abstraction (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- **Model Layer**: Data models and schemas
- **Infrastructure**: Vector DB, object storage, and task queues
