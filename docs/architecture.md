# AOMaaS Architecture

## Overview

AOMaaS (Autonomous Open-Source Maintainer as a Service) is designed as a microservices-based architecture that enables scalable, maintainable, and extensible functionality. The system is composed of several key components that work together to provide the complete service.

### Components

#### 1. Web Interface

The web interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with AOMaaS. It includes:

- User authentication and management
- Repository management
- Opportunity discovery and visualization
- Implementation planning and execution
- Pull request management

**Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

#### 2. API Server

The API server handles all requests from the web interface and external clients. It provides a RESTful API for:

- User authentication and authorization
- Repository management
- Opportunity mining
- Implementation planning
- Pull request creation and management

**Technologies**: FastAPI (Python)

#### 3. Task Workers

Task workers handle long-running tasks asynchronously. They are responsible for:

- Repository indexing
- Opportunity mining
- Implementation planning
- Code generation
- Pull request creation

**Technologies**: Celery (Python)

#### 4. Databases

AOMaaS uses multiple databases to store different types of data:

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured data (users, repositories, opportunities, plans, implementations, pull requests)
- **Redis**: In-memory database for caching and task queue management

#### 5. Vector Store

The vector store is used for semantic search and similarity matching of code snippets and documentation.

**Technologies**: Qdrant

#### 6. Object Store

The object store is used for storing large binary objects, such as repository snapshots and generated artifacts.

**Technologies**: MinIO (S3-compatible)

#### 7. AI Services

AI services provide the intelligence behind AOMaaS. They are responsible for:

- Code analysis
- Opportunity identification
- Implementation planning
- Code generation
- Pull request review

**Technologies**: Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Data Flow

1. User submits a repository URL through the web interface
2. API server creates a task for repository indexing
3. Task worker clones the repository and analyzes its structure
4. Code snippets and metadata are stored in the vector store
5. Repository metadata is stored in the PostgreSQL database

### Opportunity Mining

1. User requests opportunity mining for a repository
2. API server creates a task for opportunity mining
3. Task worker analyzes the repository using AI services
4. Identified opportunities are stored in the PostgreSQL database
5. User is notified when the mining is complete

### Implementation Planning

1. User selects an opportunity for implementation
2. API server creates a task for implementation planning
3. Task worker generates an implementation plan using AI services
4. Implementation plan is stored in the PostgreSQL database
5. User reviews and approves the implementation plan

### Implementation Execution

1. User approves an implementation plan
2. API server creates a task for implementation execution
3. Task worker generates code changes using AI services
4. Code changes are stored in the object store
5. Implementation metadata is stored in the PostgreSQL database

### Pull Request Creation

1. User requests a pull request for an implementation
2. API server creates a task for pull request creation
3. Task worker creates a pull request on the repository provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
4. Pull request metadata is stored in the PostgreSQL database
5. User is notified when the pull request is created

## Deployment Architecture

AOMaaS is designed to be deployed using Docker containers, with Docker Compose for development and Kubernetes for production environments.
